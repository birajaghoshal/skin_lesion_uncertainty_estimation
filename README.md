# Skin Lesion Classification and Uncertainty Estimation

This repository includes the TensorFlow implementation of the methods described in our paper 
[Risk-Aware Machine Learning Classifier for Medical Diagnosis](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/8/8/1241).

UPDATE: we are currently working on finalizing the codes and generating demo files. 
Everything (including both PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations) will be uploaded by February 20th.
